# 🧩 LEVEL 5 

One artifact.
Three gates.
One true path.

## 🧩 Your Mission

An artifact must cross the labyrinth.

It is born, tested, and sealed —
each step guarded by a different gate.

Only when its journey is complete
may it appear in main.

# 🛤️ The Gates of the Labyrinth

The maze is not random.

It has three named gates, and the artifact must pass through them in order:

**alpha** — where the artifact is created

**beta** — where it is carried forward

**gamma** — where it is finalized

You must create these paths yourself.

# ⚠️ Rules of the Maze

The **artifact** must move forward, not be duplicated

Feature branches must never be merged into main

The artifact must appear in main only after Gamma

Any shortcut poisons the timeline.

If the artifact:
appears too early → ❌
exists in more than one gate → ❌
skips a gate → ❌

🧠 Hint

The artifact does not walk — commits do.

Choose what you carry.
Leave the rest behind.

The cleanest path is rarely the easiest.
